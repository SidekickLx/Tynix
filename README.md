# Tynix [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SidekickLx/Tynix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SidekickLx/Tynix)

- A Shitty and usless toy OS

- Even though it is nothing but useless. 

- It is able to start up from hardware directly and handle some interrupt request.

- Maybe it will have a virtual memory management and multi-process support in the future :)

------
It is a piece of shit but you might still need a [**Usage**] (to play with shit ðŸ˜‚)

First you need gcc nasm and qemu (include system-defult-i386 arch)
```shell
  $make
  $make qemu
```
Enjoy :)
