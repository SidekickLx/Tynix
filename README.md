# Tynix

- A Shitty and usless toy OS

- Even though it is nothing but useless. 

- It is able to start up from hardware directly and hanle some interrupt request.

- Maybe it will have a virtual memory managemenet and multi-process support in the future :)

------
It is a piece of shit but you might still need a [**Usage**] (to play with shit ðŸ˜‚)

First you need a gcc and qemu(include system-defult-i386 arch)
```shell
  $make
  $make qemu
```
Enjoy :)
